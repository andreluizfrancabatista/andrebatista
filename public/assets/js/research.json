        "description": "This project intends to create, and maintain, a quality online learning environment using Discord app platform, especially a learning process oriented towards practical activities that require constant communication between students and teachers. The distance learning systems and services currently available are mainly focused on creating opportunities for teaching and interaction with teaching materials, as well as their subsequent verification by the system. Modern virtual learning environments, or distance learning systems, such as Moodle, Lotus Learning Space, Blackboard Learning System, Canvas, Google Classroom are developed based on asynchronous communication through the transfer of files, chats and electronic messages, while the quarantined educational process requires the creation of synchronous communication opportunities. This drives the need to find remoting tools focused on synchronous communication with the ability to create a single, multi-resource system for online classes. The Discord platform, compared to other Distance Education software, is capable of creating quality conditions for the synchronous educational process, while reducing the workload of computational resources, thus allowing its use even in old electronic media and with less hardware resources. Therefore, we consider relevant the study of certain topics in order to highlight the challenges, opportunities and potential of Discord and the peculiarities of its use to create a quality learning space.",

        "title": "Virtual reality environment for teaching and learning Chemistry",
        "description": "This project proposes the development of a Virtual Reality simulator for teaching in the field of Chemistry, more specifically the technique of separation of mixtures. We currently realize the importance of using digital tools in education, since the use of these technologies provides greater interactivity between students, creating an attractive and innovative environment for learning. In teaching Chemistry, practical classes conducted in laboratories are important for the teaching and learning process of students. These practical classes require the use of reagents and instruments specific to each area to carry out these practical experiments. However, most institutions and educational centers do not have the adequate infrastructure to carry out these practical activities. Either because of the high cost of equipment, samples and substances that are normally used to demonstrate such experiments, or because of the current context in which we live due to the pandemic. These two scenarios somehow limit the performance of practical classes in teaching Chemistry, and students often only have access to the theoretical concepts of the course, without having the opportunity to handle the equipment and methods of data analysis in a practical way, whether due to the physical distance from the laboratories, or even the absence of them in school institutions. In this sense, this research project presents a proposal for the development of a more dynamic teaching environment, through new technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR). VR consists in the creation of virtual environments, from the representation of objects in the real world in three-dimensional (3D) graphics, offering an approximation of reality. Within this context, VR can help the teaching-learning process, as it makes possible the recreation and simulation of complex environments. This VR environment will be a virtual laboratory that will provide an interactive development environment to create and carry out simulated experiments, making it possible to carry out experiments virtually, facilitating the understanding of theoretical concepts, minimizing difficulties for students and the costs of setting up laboratories by educational institutions. The effectiveness of using virtual laboratories is already common nowadays.",

        "description": "The search for modern, efficient and effective tools for digital protection is a research area based on the most varied spheres of science. In general, this field of research can be understood in two ways, on the one hand there are those who are looking for techniques to obtain greater digital protection. While on the other side, there are those who want to undermine protection, that is, who want to access information without authorization. One of the areas that has received a lot of attention recently is steganography. This is the art of masking information as a way to avoid detection. Steganography derives from the Greek, hence stegano = hide, mask and spelling = writing. Therefore, steganography is the art of covert writing. Steganography includes a comprehensive set of methods for secret communications developed throughout history. Among such methods are: \"invisible\" inks, micro-dots, character arrangement, digital signatures, hidden channels, spread spectrum communications, among others. Nowadays, there is research in the literature on the structuring and development of digital steganography. These surveys consist of a set of techniques and algorithms capable of enabling safer digital communication at a time when your emails can be read and your steps on a personal computer tracked. Such techniques can range from inserting images inside others ? making one seemingly innocent image hide another of greater importance without raising suspicion? even the writing of harmless texts that hide some secret message in its structure. Such techniques are also present in modern military equipment that make radio transmissions and encode more important messages into shortwaves.",

        "description": "The field of artificial intelligence is in full development and is the focus of numerous researches in the field of computing. Its use in different types of systems is increasingly common. Artificial Neural Networks is a part of computational intelligence. Its objective is to simulate the behavior of a network of natural neurons using artificial neurons. Weather affects almost every area of ​​our lives - weather conditions like fog, rain and snow travel to work and travel to places in other parts of the world. The climate affects our health as it directly affects the air we breathe (air quality), the water we drink and the food we eat. The weather affects our security as severe weather such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods often cause sudden mass destruction of homes, buildings and other infrastructure. Thanks to satellites, radar, remote sensors and other weather monitoring technologies (such as National Weather Service alerts), we now have a better understanding of weather conditions and phenomena. This is possible due to the use of forecasting techniques for meteorological data based on historical weather data patterns. Currently, there are mainly two types of weather data pattern recognition algorithms: the rule-matching algorithm and the model-matching algorithm. However, both algorithms require the participation of domain experts as well as a lack of learning ability. To solve these problems, this project proposes an approach to pattern recognition of historical meteorological data based on artificial neural networks. One of the hypotheses is that the neural network can effectively learn the characteristics of patterns and accurately recognize the patterns.",

        "description": "This project intends to mainly observe the efficiency of the neural network black box modeling capability in the case of predicting soccer match results and open several debates about the nature of prediction and selection of input parameters. The selection of input parameters is a serious problem in football match prediction systems based on neural networks or statistical methods. Several input vector suggestions are implemented in the literature, which is mainly based on direct data from weekly charts. Here in this project, two different input vector parameters will be tested through learning vector quantization networks, in order to emphasize the importance of input parameter selection. The input vector parameters introduced in this project will be investigated for their significance when compared to other studies. The results of the different approaches to be investigated in this study will be compared with each other and also with the results of other neural network approaches and statistical methods, in order to give an overview of the successful performance of the prediction. The project will also feature discussions on the nature of the concept of football match prediction that may attract the interests of researchers willing to work in this area.",

Since it is the teacher who has the responsability to choose the methodology that allows the reflection and a critical understanding about the reality in which the student is inserted, it is proposed that one of the viable ways of working the learning of Physics is to contextualize the subjects using an learning object, such as educational software based on RPG game.
