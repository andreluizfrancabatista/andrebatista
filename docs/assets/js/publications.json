    "abstract": "The relationship between literary art and algorithms is very common. Although technological resources are available to us today that facilitate the reading – and storage – of books and other works on mobile devices, little research has been done on the possible connections between these two points. In this article we present the steps to build a bridge between literature and algorithms. We describe here the interdisciplinary academic experience involving students from the Technical Course in Computing Integrated to High School, in which they carried out the transmedia adaptation of literary works to digital games produced by the students themselves. The project involved the English Language and Algorithms II curricular units, so that the suggested books read in the foreign language curricular unit served as inspiration for the construction of digital games in the programming curricular unit. The analyzes carried out through the observation of the professors on the students show that this didactic-pedagogical action can improve student engagement in relation to the topics taught in both curricular units, and also indicate that it is possible to build a solid bridge between literature and algorithms.",

The inclusion of students in research development projects shows that teaching is not, and cannot be, disconnected from research, as both complement each other. Teaching combined with research contributes to meaningful and contextualized learning, thus enhancing teaching and learning practice. Such teaching practices, when combined with research activities, provide a differentiated look at education, ie, transform the understanding of the way of educating. Through a historical redemption of event annals, teachers’ personal records and online media news, we report here the trajectory of IFTM campus Ituiutaba and its performances in science fairs, dissemination of research project results, as well as awards and awards. acknowledgments received. Additionally, we have developed an interactive timeline that is available online at <http://bit.ly/linha-do-IFTM> with photos, videos and more information about this trajectory of our campus by science and technology fairs in Brazil and abroad.",

Investigating alternative teaching methods is essential to encourage students to learn and understand the concepts of programming. The use of games in learning and training is advocated and supported by many researchers due to its motivational and attractive features. This study focuses on an approach that supports the use of learning methodologies based on constructionist activities. Therefore, a pedagogical framework is proposed to guide lecturers who teach programming on how to integrate games-based learning to present coding concepts in the context of familiar realworld applications like computer games development. The framework is supported by motivational and attractive game features in conjunction with the authentic and meaningful aspects of constructionist activities for Games-Based Construction Learning (GBCL).  This paper summarises and presents a framework model based on a literature review and a panel of experts, with a view to performing a two-stage process to validate this framework. The paper discusses the design and validation of the framework and proposes actions regarding its implementation.",

A feedforward multilayer perceptron ANN was used, the results of which are close to reality. The main findings are that: real prices of charcoal dropped between 1975 and 2000 and rose from the early 21st century; the ANN with two hidden layers was the architecture making the best prediction; the most effective learning rate was 0.99 and 600 cycles, representing the most satisfactory and accurate ANN training. Prediction using ANN was found to be more accurate when compared by the mean squared error to other studies modeling charcoal price series in Minas Gerais state.",

    "abstract": "The present work investigates two different methodologies to perform prediction of time series of fluvial flows. Models from the Box & Jenkins method were constructed, as well as models based on the technique of Artificial Neural Networks. The proposed models were used to predict future values of the historical series of natural discharges from Rio Grande. The time series data were collected in the control section at the fluviometric station of Madre de Deus de Minas, MG. Subsequently a comparative analysis was made between both techniques used in the prognosis of the time series. The results obtained in the comparison show that each methodology can be adjusted appropriately to the set of observations under study, however each technique has advantages and disadvantages.",

    "abstract": "In spite of exist a series of standards about software quality, besides them do not be specific for the agricultural domain, they little approachs the involved people’s influence and the organization. In function of that, the objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the possible relationships between the profile of the programmers of agricultural software and the agreement degree with sub-characteristics of the standard ISO 9126, adapted for the domain. The sample was composed by 30 programmers that answered to 15 statements regarding that standard, as well as information of demographic and social character, and information on their bond with the company. For treatment of the data, two statistical multivariated techniques were used: correlation, and factorial analysis. The results of the correlations allowed to conclude that the programmers approaches quality with a tendency to value what can be noticed quickly by the final user; the factorial analysis results allowed the reduction of the variables in five factors and the factor “attendance and clarity” was what more included correlations and it demonstrated that the variables that form it are more affected for the demographic and social data.",
