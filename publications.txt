[Portuguese]Papers
André Luiz França Batista, Rodrigo Grassi Martins, Ailton Luiz Dias Siqueira Junior
Boletim Técnico IFTM, v. 4, p. 16-21, 2019. ISSN 2447-5998.
Publication year: 2019
Abstract
We are here to expose the record of the participation of the Ituiutaba campus of the Federal Institute of Triangulo Mineiro (IFTM) in science and technology fairs. At these events, students have the opportunity to be in close contact with other researchers of similar age who are facing similar problems and with the same aspiration: learning through research. The inclusion of students in research development projects shows that teaching is not, and cannot be, disconnected from research, as both complement each other. Teaching combined with research contributes to meaningful and contextualized learning, thus enhancing teaching and learning practice. Such teaching practices, when combined with research activities, provide a differentiated look at education, ie, transform the understanding of the way of educating. Through a historical redemption of event annals, teachers’ personal records and online media news, we report here the trajectory of IFTM campus Ituiutaba and its performances in science fairs, dissemination of research project results, as well as awards and awards. acknowledgments received. Additionally, we have developed an interactive timeline that is available online at <http://bit.ly/linha-do-IFTM> with photos, videos and more information about this trajectory of our campus by science and technology fairs in Brazil and abroad.

[English]Conference paper
André Luiz França Batista, Thomas M. Connolly, José Andre Peres Angotti
Proceedings of the 10th European Conference on Games Based Learning, 2016. v. 1. p. 815-823.
Publication year: 2016
Abstract
Computer programming is a challenge for students and a major reason why people avoid Computer Science courses. Investigating alternative teaching methods is essential to encourage students to learn and understand the concepts of programming. The use of games in learning and training is advocated and supported by many researchers due to its motivational and attractive features. This study focuses on an approach that supports the use of learning methodologies based on constructionist activities. Therefore, a pedagogical framework is proposed to guide lecturers who teach programming on how to integrate games-based learning to present coding concepts in the context of familiar realworld applications like computer games development. The framework is supported by motivational and attractive game features in conjunction with the authentic and meaningful aspects of constructionist activities for Games-Based Construction Learning (GBCL).  This paper summarises and presents a framework model based on a literature review and a panel of experts, with a view to performing a two-stage process to validate this framework. The paper discusses the design and validation of the framework and proposes actions regarding its implementation.

ABSTRACT
Energy is an important factor of economic growth and is critical to the stability of a nation. Charcoal is a renewable energy resource and is a fundamental input to the development of the Brazilian forest-based industry. The objective of this study is to provide a prognosis of the charcoal price series for the year 2007 by using Artificial Neural Networks. A feedforward multilayer perceptron ANN was used, the results of which are close to reality. The main findings are that: real prices of charcoal dropped between 1975 and 2000 and rose from the early 21st century; the ANN with two hidden layers was the architecture making the best prediction; the most effective learning rate was 0.99 and 600 cycles, representing the most satisfactory and accurate ANN training. Prediction using ANN was found to be more accurate when compared by the mean squared error to other studies modeling charcoal price series in Minas Gerais state.

Abstract
Rehabilitation engineering seeks to develop technologies that help people with some form of disability to alleviate their limitations, improving their quality of life. Visually impaired people have serious difficulties in urban mobility since most of the traffic signaling is based on vision. In this sense, this work proposes the construction of a device to assist the visually impaired to identify the state of urban traffic lights through touch. For this, a device will generate vibration patterns that can be interpreted as being different states of the traffic lights. A simulator was built as proof of concept of this technique. This work presents details of the construction of this simulator.

Abstract
In the last three decades, the concept of the clinical-anthropological sciences has raised doubts about the evaluation mechanisms on deafness and how they are or are inserted in the medico-social and educational context; the concepts that point to these different representations about deafness have also entered the agenda. The process of transforming social into biological issues, called “biologization” (clinical character) is well known in the history of mankind, and its consequences for education have led to erroneous interpretations of deafness and, in particular, to deafness. pedagogical practice of the teaching of students with hearing impairment, other strong evidence and on the issue of social inclusion, since it opens an important meaning in the bulge of Brazilian educational policy. Many hearing impaired people tend to have difficulty communicating with their educators. Many times the disabled student stops learning because of the lack of interaction between educator and student, and for this reason, hearing aid software was created to facilitate communication between educators and students.

Abstract
In the last years it is possible to see a great advance in the areas of electronics, computer science, automation and information technology. This advance was accompanied by a reduction in the costs of implementing systems in these areas. This cost reduction allows a system that once cost thousands of dollars and could only be deployed in one industry, could be applied in other areas such as in people’s homes. In this context, the automation of home automation systems was introduced in the 1980s. Such systems are created with the purpose of simplifying people’s lives, satisfying their communication, comfort and safety needs. This is done through the automatic control of existing elements in residential environments such as lighting elements, air conditioning and safety equipment.

Abstract
In spite of exist a series of standards about software quality, besides them do not be specific for the agricultural domain, they little approachs the involved people’s influence and the organization. In function of that, the objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the possible relationships between the profile of the programmers of agricultural software and the agreement degree with sub-characteristics of the standard ISO 9126, adapted for the domain. The sample was composed by 30 programmers that answered to 15 statements regarding that standard, as well as information of demographic and social character, and information on their bond with the company. For treatment of the data, two statistical multivariated techniques were used: correlation, and factorial analysis. The results of the correlations allowed to conclude that the programmers approaches quality with a tendency to value what can be noticed quickly by the final user; the factorial analysis results allowed the reduction of the variables in five factors and the factor “attendance and clarity” was what more included correlations and it demonstrated that the variables that form it are more affected for the demographic and social data.
