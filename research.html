                                                    <p>Recently, well-known organizations and initiatives indicate the
                                                        importance of learning to code from basic education to higher
                                                        levels of training. This has raised interest in research on new
                                                        methodologies and teaching practices in Computer Science. Much
                                                        of my work and research focus on the human-centred approaches in
                                                        the use of games to teaching various Computer Science topics
                                                        including programming.</p>
                                                    <p>Our results show that the use of games in learning has been
                                                        effective in some topics and it can make positive changes in the
                                                        world. However we still need to research how to effectively
                                                        introduce and use the new educational technologies in the
                                                        classroom.</p>
                                                    <p>I also have interest and experience in others emerging research
                                                        fields. Highlight to educational robotics using Arduino focusing
                                                        on smart homes, Internet of Things and motions sensors. Another
                                                        research field can be identified in my previous works that
                                                        includes artificial intelligence for time series forecasting,
                                                        character recognition, and prediction of soccer match results.

                                        <p>Recent studies show that stock patterns may imply useful information for
                                            forecasting stock prices. Patterns underlying price time series cannot be
                                            exhaustively discovered by pure human power in a limited time, so the
                                            computational algorithm for recognizing stock price patterns becomes
                                            increasingly popular. Currently, there are mainly two types of stock price
                                            pattern recognition algorithms: the rule matching algorithm and the model
                                            matching algorithm. However, both algorithms require the participation of
                                            domain experts as well as a lack of learning ability. To address these
                                            problems, this project proposes a stock price pattern recognition approach
                                            based on the artificial neural network. One hypothesis is that the neural
                                            network can effectively learn pattern characteristics and accurately
                                            recognize patterns.</p>

                                            RPG game as a learning object for the awareness and contextualization of the
                                            learning of Physics, in the scope of High School. Learning Physics enables
                                            students to observe the changes that occur in the environment, thus
                                            improving their understanding of the contents.</p>
                                        <p>Since it is the teacher who has the responsability to choose the methodology
                                            that allows the reflection and a critical understanding about the reality in
                                            which the student is inserted, it is proposed that one of the viable ways of
                                            working the learning of Physics is to contextualize the subjects using an
                                            learning object, such as educational software based on RPG game.</p>
                                        <p>We hope as results from this work, that the use of this tool can make the
                                            class more interesting, contextualized and easy to understand on subjects
                                            related to Physics.</p>

                                            The use of games in learning and training is advocated and supported by many
                                            researchers due to its motivational and attractive features.</p>
                                        <p>This study focuses on an approach that supports the use of learning

                                        <p>Therefore, a pedagogical framework is proposed to guide lecturers who teach

                                            disabilities. In development we use (a) a sensor body movements; (b) a
                                            structure in the form of a robotic mechanical arm; and (c) a software for

                                        <p>Experiments were performed to verify the appropriateness of that interface,
                                            to identify possible failures, and to implement improvements. The
                                            experimental results have shown that the interface works properly without

                                        <p>Goals<br />
                                            The objective of the project is to use ANN to develop different AI systems
                                            capable of: a) forecast meteorological data based on historical data; b)
                                            serve as a basis for future applications such as climate or financial time
                                            series behavioral prediction software; c) predict soccer match results; d)
                                            perform character recognition.</p>

                                        <p>The advancement of electronics and computing made it possible to use home
                                            automation systems to create domotics, or home automation. Among the various
                                            applications of home automation include the improvement of comfort,
                                            rationing of resources, safety and assistance to people with disabilities
                                            and the elderly.</p>
                                        <p>This work describes an Internet remote control system consisting of a
                                            microcontroller, a web server and client applications. The system allows the
                                            remote control of the lighting system and other devices of the residence
                                            through a cellular or computer. The system was built using common electronic
                                            components and free software, forming a cost-effective and easy-to-deploy
                                            system. For a device with internet access, the user can manage the house
                                            through a 3D model that addresses the concepts of virtual reality or a web
