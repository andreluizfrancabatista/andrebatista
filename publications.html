                                                    <p>We are here to expose the record of the participation of the
                                                        Ituiutaba campus of the Federal Institute of Triangulo Mineiro
                                                        (IFTM) in science and technology fairs. At these events,
                                                        students have the opportunity to be in close contact with other
                                                        researchers of similar age who are facing similar problems and
                                                        with the same aspiration: learning through research. The
                                                        inclusion of students in research development projects shows
                                                        that teaching is not, and cannot be, disconnected from research,
                                                        as both complement each other. Teaching combined with research
                                                        contributes to meaningful and contextualized learning, thus
                                                        enhancing teaching and learning practice. Such teaching
                                                        practices, when combined with research activities, provide a
                                                        differentiated look at education, ie, transform the
                                                        understanding of the way of educating. Through a historical

                                                    <p>This paper presents an online educational game called “SQL
                                                        Planet” &#8211; based on the concept of text-mode adventures
                                                        with storyline, storytelling, and characters. The peculiarity of
                                                        this game, however, is that the player controls his character
                                                        only through commands in Structured Query Language (SQL). All
                                                        commands required to progress in the game are initially
                                                        presented, so no prior SQL knowledge is required.</p>

                                                        Subsequently, we discuss how private companies, specifically

                                                    <p>This article presents the concept of game design for a game with
                                                        educational objectives for teaching and learning concepts and
                                                        practices useful in scientific methodology. The game is inspired
                                                        by the board game Snakes and Ladders, but adapted with
                                                        additional features to make it focused on scientific
                                                        methodology. In addition, the game will be dependent on skill
                                                        and judgment rather than luck and randomness. We hope that
                                                        through this game students will be able to learn the essential
                                                        components for good research.</p>

                                                    <p>This article presents a scientific research aiming the
                                                        development of a natural interface for the control of robotic
                                                        structures. The purpose of this interface is to be used as a
                                                        tool for the social integration of people with special needs. On
                                                        studies we used (a) a body motion sensor; (b) an arm robot
                                                        mechanical structure; and (c) a software for communication
                                                        between the motion sensor and the robot arm. Experiments were
                                                        performed to verify the effectiveness of this interface, to
                                                        identify possible failures, and implement improvements. The main
                                                        results indicated that the interface works satisfactorily.</p>

                                                        Subsequently, we discuss how private companies, specifically

                                                    <p>Computer programming is a challenge for students and a major
                                                        reason why people avoid Computer Science courses. Investigating
                                                        alternative teaching methods is essential to encourage students
                                                        to learn and understand the concepts of programming. The use of
                                                        games in learning and training is advocated and supported by
                                                        many researchers due to its motivational and attractive
                                                        features. This study focuses on an approach that supports the
                                                        use of learning methodologies based on constructionist
                                                        activities. Therefore, a pedagogical framework is proposed to
                                                        guide lecturers who teach programming on how to integrate

                                                        of familiar realworld applications like computer games
                                                        development. The framework is supported by motivational and
                                                        attractive game features in conjunction with the authentic and
                                                        meaningful aspects of constructionist activities for Games-Based
                                                        Construction Learning (GBCL). This paper summarises and presents
                                                        a framework model based on a literature review and a panel of

                                                    <p>Energy is an important factor of economic growth and is critical
                                                        to the stability of a nation. Charcoal is a renewable energy
                                                        resource and is a fundamental input to the development of the
                                                        Brazilian forest-based industry. The objective of this study is
                                                        to provide a prognosis of the charcoal price series for the year
                                                        2007 by using Artificial Neural Networks. A feedforward
                                                        multilayer perceptron ANN was used, the results of which are
                                                        close to reality. The main findings are that: real prices of
                                                        charcoal dropped between 1975 and 2000 and rose from the early
                                                        21st century; the ANN with two hidden layers was the
                                                        architecture making the best prediction; the most effective
                                                        learning rate was 0.99 and 600 cycles, representing the most
                                                        satisfactory and accurate ANN training. Prediction using ANN was
                                                        found to be more accurate when compared by the mean squared
                                                        error to other studies modeling charcoal price series in Minas

                                                    <p>In Futsal, as in other collective sports games, the essence of
                                                        income is related to the physical, technical, tactical,
                                                        psychological, clinical and administrative components. Overall,
                                                        the sport has received several contributions stemming from the
                                                        advancement of technology. This project proposes the development
                                                        of an easy-to-use computer application that allows entry,
                                                        processing and feedback of the data, with the objective of
                                                        performing the sports scout to follow the collective sporting
                                                        modality, Futsal, during the friendly games of the team of IFTM.
                                                        The methodology used in the elaboration of the application will
                                                        be developed from techniques in object oriented programming with
                                                        the final implementation realized in Java language. Application
                                                        feasibility tests will be conducted during IFTM Futsal friendly
                                                        matches to provide input to discuss the use of the database in
                                                        assessing the IFTM Futsal team&#8217;s sports performance, as
                                                        the statistical record of a set of games or an entire season
                                                        contributes to medium- and long-term solutions to team problems.
                                                        Finally, it is worth mentioning that it is possible to continue
                                                        the project proposed here for one year.</p>

                                                        limitations, improving their quality of life. Visually impaired
                                                        people have serious difficulties in urban mobility since most of
                                                        the traffic signaling is based on vision. In this sense, this
                                                        work proposes the construction of a device to assist the

                                                        through touch. For this, a device will generate vibration

                                                        have led to erroneous interpretations of deafness and, in

                                                        students with hearing impairment, other strong evidence and on
                                                        the issue of social inclusion, since it opens an important
                                                        meaning in the bulge of Brazilian educational policy. Many
                                                        hearing impaired people tend to have difficulty communicating
                                                        with their educators. Many times the disabled student stops
                                                        learning because of the lack of interaction between educator and
                                                        student, and for this reason, hearing aid software was created
                                                        to facilitate communication between educators and students.</p>

                                                        information technology. This advance was accompanied by a
                                                        reduction in the costs of implementing systems in these areas.
                                                        This cost reduction allows a system that once cost thousands of

                                                    <p>Irrigation is an important tool in optimizing production and
                                                        improving the quality of agricultural products. However, it is
                                                        necessary criteria in the use of water resources and energy
                                                        expenditure in the process. This work proposes the development
                                                        of a digital tensiometer for use in an automatic irrigation
                                                        management system. For this, the analog gauge of a tensiometer
                                                        will be replaced by a pressure sensor. The electric circuit of
                                                        this sensor was designed and the tests showed that it is capable
                                                        of detecting pressure variations.</p>

                                                        neural networks technique have been constructed. The proposed
                                                        models were used in order to forecast future values of the

                                                        Madre de Deus de Minas, MG. Afterwards, a comparative analysis

                                                        multivariated techniques were used: correlation, and factorial
                                                        analysis. The results of the correlations allowed to conclude
